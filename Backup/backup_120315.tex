Throughout this thesis, I am going to explore the applications of argumentation theory in the context of nonmonotonic reasoning.\\
First off, I will introduce the necessary formal definitions, give a few easy examples as clarification and draw the theoretical conclusions.\\
In the next step, the reader is given an overview over the real-life applications of argumentation theory.\\
Finally I will append the documentation of an application specifically written during the course of this thesis, which purpose is to graphically help understanding the subject.\\

%Nonmonotonic reasoning
\section{Nonmonotonic Reasoning}
\begin{flushleft}
When talking about nonmonotonic reasoning, one is referring to the process of deducing knowledge within a formal logic,
whose consequence relation does not fulfill the requirements of monotonicity.
%Definition of Monotonicity :TODO evtl. noch ein bsp. einbauen? auf default logic verweisen?
\begin{defn}[Monotonicity]
If for a given set of formulas $\bm{\psi}$ and a formula $\bm{A}$ the logical consequence $\bm{\psi \vdash A}$ holds, then $\bm{\psi,B \vdash A}$ still holds.
\end{defn}
As one can see, nonmonotonic sets of formulas might change their deducable knowledge as new facts are added. 
\end{flushleft}

\section{Argumentation Theory}
\begin{flushleft}
In a human context, we (hopefully) argue to reach a sound conclusion. We do that by claiming statements based on premisses, and usually, due to different perception and other factors,
these statements tend to vary in their degree of believability.

Argumentation Theory, from a logical point of view, tries to formalize these strategies and introduces rules to that purpose. 
Most of the definitions in this thesis were originally introduced in \cite{Dung}
